# pong

It's a web game with inspiration of **Ping Pong**. The ball and game theme are based on the dancer, *Ricardo*.

## Thoughts

I always think it's cool how you can code a game to play on the web using JavaScript. Pong is such a classic game, and it is actually pretty easy to code as well. I thought this was a very fun project for the last project of this course!



## About

A web-based app uses Canvas HTML elements to create a classic pong game. Users play against a computer AI, whoever first reaches 7 points wins.
